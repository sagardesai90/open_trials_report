# Open Trials Report
Using Open Trials API to generate reports based on user search queries.

## Description
This is a client side app thats lets the user search for articles through the Open Trials API. The user can search any query, select the number of items they'd like to see, and view them in a systematic way. There is also the ability to print to PDF each of the reports.

## Instructions for Use
1- $ yarn install
2- $ yarn start

Although, I do plan on deploying the app to Heroku/Netlify so there may not be a need to clone the repo to view the app.
